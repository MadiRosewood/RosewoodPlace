            <p>In the past two years, several companies have taken the turn of versatile bikes! If before (this is still the case, do not worry) companies pushed to the maximum the specialization of a bike so that it is the fastest in the world, or the lightest, or even the most comfortable, here it is. that the new trend, thanks to new technologies, makes it possible to combine the advantages of all these types of bicycle in one!

            <h2>All-In-One
            </h2>
            <i>The new BMC Roadmachine 2017 corresponds to this new philosophy, positioning itself between their endurance bike, GranFondo, and their performance bike, Teammachine.
            </i>
            <p>The “All-In-One” label fits perfectly with the Roadmachine series. Integration, lightness, flexibility, everything is there! The new bike benefits from an integrated cockpit (the Roadmachine 01 only) that combines an independent stem, fork and handlebars with full integration for the Shimano Di2 system and hydraulic disc brakes. The new bike also incorporates the new “D” seatpost that holds in place with an integrated clamping system that adjusts with the push of a button on the top tube.

            <h2>Lightweight frame
            </h2>
            <p>The frame of the top-of-the-line Roadmachine 01 version is built with Premium carbon claiming a weight of 920g (size 54cm), while the fork weighs 390g and the seat post 160g. For the Roadmachine 02 version, we announce a frame / fork weight of 1100g / 430g, while the aluminum version Roadmachine 03 obtains a ratio of 1270g / 420g.
            </p>
            <h2>Disk Brakes
            </h2>
            <p>All bikes are equipped with hydraulic flatmount type disc brakes compatible with 140mm or 160mm rotors.
